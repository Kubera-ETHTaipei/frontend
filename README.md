## Introduction

Kubera is an application designed to provide credit scores to users within the Ethereum ecosystem. It offers two main sections: the User Section and the DeFi Protocol Section. Kubera aims to provide transparency and trustworthiness in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by offering credit scoring services.

## User Section

In the User Section, users can log in via any Ethereum Wallet and view their credit scores. If users have updated their scores before, the page will display their current score. Otherwise, it will show a default score of 0. Users can choose to update their scores by clicking the "Update" button. Once the update is complete, the new score will be visible.

## DeFi Protocol Section

For the alpha stage, only whitelisted or trusted DeFi protocols will have access to the Kubera application. DeFi protocols that wish to access the platform must fill out a Deform, providing details about themselves and the protocol they represent. Once the details are verified, the protocol's address will be whitelisted. After that, they can access Kubera in its full form.

## Whitelisted DeFi Protocols

Whitelisted DeFi protocols can utilize Kubera to check the score of a user's address. They can input the user's address and set a threshold score (minimum score required for acceptance). Both fields are compulsory. After submission, the code will check if the user's score is greater than the threshold and return true or false accordingly. It's important to note that the protocol will not have access to view the actual score of any user.

## How to Use

1. **User Section**:

   - Visit the User Section on the webpage.
   - Log in via Ethereum Wallet.
   - View your credit score.
   - Optionally, update your score by clicking the "Update" button.

2. **DeFi Protocol Section**:

   - If you're a DeFi protocol, fill out the Deform on the platform.
   - Wait for verification and whitelisting of your address.
   - Once whitelisted, you can access Kubera's full functionality.

3. **Checking User Scores**:
   - For whitelisted DeFi protocols, input the user's address and set a threshold score.
   - Submit the form to check if the user's score meets the threshold.
